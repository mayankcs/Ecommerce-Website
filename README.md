ecommerce website

This is the code for ecommerce website which has almost all basic backend logic implemented in it.


We have two roles of users 
1) Customer :- the one who purchase 
2) Seller :- the one who sells
3) Shipper:- ( *Future goal* )

**Q. Why this Website stands out ?**
I made this Ecommerce-website within just two days ðŸŽ¯ , it was bit challenging but i first broken down task in sub task and then started doing everything right from writing backend logic in Django and frontend using HTML and CSS.

## Walk through Website ðŸš¶

initially we have homepage which has all products listed out, so that user can have a broad look on them. 

**Q. What user can do ?**
 - Add products to cart
 - Purchase products
 - *(we will add more features later on)*
 
**Q. What Seller can do ?**
 - Add products for selling
 - Update product on the sell
 - Have detailed analysis of every order
 - *(we will add more features later on)*

Most important part is the **Seller Profile**, as sellers add product to website which are listed their on homepage of website.

When seller get's logged in, then he/she is redirected to special page which is seller dashboard where seller will find all their products uploaded for selling. seller can even update stock on the same page and also can check every order in detail
